- **Risk Violations**: Severity-based violation system with automatic actions
- **Position Monitoring**: Stop-loss execution and position size controls
- **Trading Halt**: Automatic trading suspension for critical violations

### Trade Logging System
- **TradeLogger**: Comprehensive transaction logging and audit trails
- **Multiple Formats**: JSON, CSV, and text logging with rotation policies
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history with user attribution
- **Log Management**: Automatic rotation, compression, and archival

   - Webhook provider for custom integrations
   - Slack/Discord integration for team notifications

3. **Message Management**
   - Template-based message formatting
   - Notification history and tracking
   - Delivery status monitoring
   - Failed delivery handling and escalation

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
1. **Risk Controller Integration**
   - Monitor risk violations from RiskController
   - Trigger alerts for critical risk events
   - Escalate notifications based on violation severity

2. **Market Data Integration**
   - Use WebSocketHandler for real-time price feeds
   - Leverage MarketDataClient for historical comparisons
   - Integrate with DataCache for efficient data access

3. **Portfolio Analysis Integration**
   - Use PortfolioAnalyzer for performance metrics
   - Integrate with RiskManager for risk assessments
   - Leverage TechnicalAnalysis for market indicators

### Configuration Requirements
1. **Monitoring Configuration**
   - Alert thresholds and sensitivity settings
   - Monitoring intervals and data sources
   - Market hours and trading session awareness

2. **Notification Configuration**
   - Provider credentials and endpoints
   - Recipient lists and contact preferences
   - Message templates and formatting rules

## Technical Considerations
