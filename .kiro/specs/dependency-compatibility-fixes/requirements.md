# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical dependency compatibility issues in the financial portfolio automation system, specifically the bcrypt version incompatibility with passlib and the missing Alpaca environment configuration attribute. These issues are preventing smooth system startup and could impact authentication and trading functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to start without dependency errors, so that all authentication and security features work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL NOT display bcrypt version compatibility errors
2. WHEN passlib attempts to load bcrypt backend THEN the system SHALL successfully access version information
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the bcrypt hashing SHALL function without errors
4. IF bcrypt version conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL use compatible dependency versions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear dependency version specifications, so that the system can be deployed consistently across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing project dependencies THEN the system SHALL specify exact compatible versions for bcrypt and passlib
2. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL prevent version conflicts through proper constraints
3. WHEN updating dependencies THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility for existing functionality
4. IF dependency conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the Alpaca integration to initialize properly, so that I can access paper trading and market data features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the Alpaca client SHALL initialize without configuration errors
2. WHEN accessing AlpacaConfig THEN the system SHALL find the required 'environment' attribute
3. WHEN connecting to Alpaca services THEN the system SHALL use the correct environment configuration
4. IF Alpaca configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with resolution steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive error handling for dependency issues, so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve startup problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependency errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN version conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest specific resolution steps
3. WHEN configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on required settings
4. IF multiple dependency issues exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize and report them systematically
