# Development Documentation

This directory contains development-related documentation for the Financial Portfolio Automation system.

## Structure

- `handoffs/` - Task handoff documentation and completion summaries
- `deployment/` - Deployment guides and troubleshooting
- `system-reports/` - System analysis and status reports

## Task Development History

The system was built incrementally through a series of tasks. Each task has associated handoff documentation that describes:

- What was implemented
- Key decisions made
- Testing approach
- Integration points
- Next steps

See the `handoffs/` directory for detailed task-by-task documentation.

## Development Workflow

1. **Requirements Analysis** - Define what needs to be built
2. **Design** - Create technical design and architecture
3. **Implementation** - Build the feature with tests
4. **Integration** - Integrate with existing system
5. **Documentation** - Update handoff notes and documentation

Each major feature follows this workflow with handoff documentation at each stage.
