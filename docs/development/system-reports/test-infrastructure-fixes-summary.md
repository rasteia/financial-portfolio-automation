# Test Infrastructure Fixes Summary

## Overview
Fixed critical test infrastructure issues that were preventing strategy tests from running properly. The main issues were related to missing technical analysis methods and incorrect mock configurations.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Technical Analysis Methods
**Problem**: Strategy classes were trying to use technical analysis methods that didn't exist:
- `calculate_rsi` method was missing from TechnicalAnalysis class
- `calculate_macd` method was missing from TechnicalAnalysis class

**Solution**: 
- Added `calculate_rsi` method to TechnicalAnalysis class with proper RSI calculation logic
- Added `calculate_macd` alias method that returns tuple format expected by strategies
- Both methods now return proper data structures with None values for insufficient data periods

### 2. Mock Configuration Issues
**Problem**: Tests were using `@patch` decorators that weren't working because:
- Strategy classes create their own TechnicalAnalysis instances in `__init__`
- Mocked methods were returning insufficient data for strategy logic
- Mock data didn't account for None values in early periods of technical indicators

**Solution**:
- Changed from `@patch` decorator approach to directly setting mock instances on strategy objects
- Updated mock data to include proper None values for early periods (e.g., `[None] * 19 + [60.0]`)
- Ensured mock data has enough historical values for crossover comparisons (MACD, moving averages)

### 3. Strategy Logic Requirements
**Problem**: Some tests failed because they didn't account for strategy business logic:
- Bearish momentum signals require existing positions to sell
- Mean reversion overbought signals require existing positions to sell
- Technical indicators need sufficient historical data for comparisons

**Solution**:
- Added Position objects to tests that require selling signals
- Used correct Position model field names (`cost_basis` instead of `average_cost`)
- Ensured mock data provides enough values for strategy logic (e.g., MACD crossover checks)

### 4. Parameter Validation Inconsistency
**Problem**: Mean reversion strategy validation expected `deviation_threshold` parameter but implementation used `std_dev_threshold`

**Solution**: Updated validation in `config.py` to use `std_dev_threshold` to match strategy implementation

## Test Results
- **Momentum Strategy Tests**: 10/10 passing ✅
- **Mean Reversion Strategy Tests**: 12/12 passing ✅

## Files Modified
1. `financial_portfolio_automation/analysis/technical_analysis.py`
   - Added `calculate_rsi` method
   - Added `calculate_macd` alias method

2. `tests/test_momentum_strategy.py`
   - Fixed mock configuration for bullish/bearish signal tests
   - Fixed multiple symbols test
   - Added Position objects for sell signal tests

3. `tests/test_mean_reversion_strategy.py`
   - Fixed mock configuration for oversold/overbought signal tests
   - Added Position objects for sell signal tests
   - Fixed parameter names in tests

4. `financial_portfolio_automation/models/config.py`
   - Updated mean reversion parameter validation to use `std_dev_threshold`

## Key Learnings
1. When mocking classes that are instantiated in `__init__`, direct assignment works better than `@patch`
2. Technical indicator mocks need to account for None values in early periods
3. Strategy tests need to consider business logic requirements (positions for sell signals)
4. Parameter validation should match actual implementation usage

## Next Steps
The test infrastructure is now stable and ready for continued development. All strategy tests are passing and properly mock the technical analysis dependencies.
